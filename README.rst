Yombo Gateway Overview
======================

The `Yombo Gateway Framework <https://yombo.net/>`_ is used for home and business automation. This
framework provides a base foundation that can be easily extended with module
to provide advanced functionality. Support for automation protocols occurs
through the use of modules; such as X10, Z-Wave, Insteon, Zigbee, etc.

This framework can also act a bridge between vendor protocols. For example,
an X10 controler can be used to control Z-Wave products.

`Modules <https://yombo.net/features/modules/>`_ can:

* Extend the features of the framework through the use of `hooks <https://yombo.net/docs/Hooks>`_.
* Provide additional API features to other modules.
* Provide advanced automation rules and tasks.

Documentation
=============

For new users, check out the quick start guide at https://yombo.net/docs/Gateway/Quick_start

Otherwise, full documentation can be found at https://yombo.net/docs/

To created intermediate to advanced automation rules or to extend the
capabilites of the gateway, consider `developing a module <https://yombo.net/docs/Developing_modules>`_.

============
Python 3.6.x
============

It's HIGHLY recommended to use latest Python 3.6 version. A simple script is located in yombo/install,
to setup:
1) Go to the yombo gateway directory (where this README file is located)
2) install/setup_pyenv.sh

On a Raspberry Pi 3, this will take quite a while. On a Raspberry Pi Zero, it's best to enjoy some
lunch or dinner at your favorite place or simply use
`one of our images <https://yombo.net/docs/Gateway/Raspberry_Pi_from_bare_metal>`_.
